	* -P sets the Width value just like -k.
	* pcmp() quickly returns when the comparands are identical.
	* Added resources for the Windows executable.

1.4.0	24 February 2016
	* Added 11 new algorithms, CRC-4/INTERLAKEN, CRC-7/UMTS,
	  CRC-8/LTE, CRC-8/SAE-J1850, CRC-11/UMTS, CRC-16/LJ1200,

	  an alias.
	* Split off presets into preset.c.

1.3.1	31 July 2015
	* Numerical (not raw) arguments and option parameters accept and
	  discard hexadecimal prefixes 0x, $ and &.
	* Compacted preset alias table.

1.3.0	9 April 2015
	* Added -z switch to accept direct binary strings.

1.2.0a  11 February 2014
	* ARM Tube OS binary included.

1.2.0	28 January 2014
	* Reintroduced third-party getopt library for RISC OS.
	* Compacted preset model table and resolved pointer cast
	  warnings.

1.1.5	14 January 2014
	* Corrected CRC-40/GSM based on new evidence (thanks to Mark
	  Cammidge, Peralex).
	* Added CRC-8/DVB-S2 from the CRC catalogue (thanks to Hartmut
	  Brandt, German Aerospace Center).
	* Added the new alias CRC-8/AES from the CRC catalogue.
	* Further efficiencies in the polynomial handling code when
	  BMP_BIT is a power of two.

1.1.4	14 October 2013
	* Added CRC-13/BBC and six cdma2000 algorithms from the CRC
	  catalogue.

1.1.3	28 September 2013

	  are refused.
	* The Init or XorOut value is solved using the shortest
	  argument.
	* Enabled more efficient polynomial handling code when BMP_BIT
	  is a power of two.

1.1.2	11 June 2013
	* Preset model checking in -s matches Init and Xorout values
	  given as 0.  The input model is canonicalised in all modes
	  before processing (based on WIDTH for -s, based on POLY for
	  the other modes).
	* The first progress message is omitted for tidier output.
	* BMP_BIT and BMP_SUB are validated at compile time.

1.1.1	22 April 2013
	* Polynomials in progress messages are printed in the correct
	  format for -p and -q.

1.1.0	9 February 2013
	* Added -q option, removed hidden -W option.
	* Prints progress messages during search.

1.05	20 January 2013
	* Corrected a transcription error in the Poly value of
	  CRC-82/DARC.  Most architectures were unaffected.
	* The Perl script now automatically generates code for the large
	  polynomial bitmaps used in the preset model tables.

1.04	18 January 2013
	* -s checks even a fully specified model against the supplied
	  arguments.
	* Fixed internal searches for first and last significant terms
	  on machines with non-power-of-2 word lengths.

1.03	19 July 2012
	* Added algorithm CRC-8/EBU from the CRC catalogue.

1.02	16 July 2012
	* Added algorithm CRC-15/MPT1327 from the CRC catalogue.
	* Added a Perl script to relink the preset model tables.
	* Search iterates through the solutions of Init slightly more
	  efficiently.

1.01	28 May 2012
	* Source code constrained to characters in the ANSI C
	  repertoire.  $ in the Williams model records replaced with 0x.
	* Unused parameter removed from modpol().

1.00	25 May 2012
	* Removed two parity models not in the CRC catalogue.
	* Init values are reverse engineered by Ewing's method, which
	  runs in O(n^3) time and is therefore much faster on wide CRCs.
	* Attempts to do a crossed-endian search are refused.  Crossed-
	  endian searching had not been properly implemented since
	  version 0.13.
	* -D dumps the parameters of all models as well as their names.

0.62	12 April 2012
	* Added algorithm CRC-31/PHILIPS from the CRC catalogue.

0.61	3 March 2012
	* Reads files properly when the -a parameter is at maximum.
	* Prints Williams model records in a single-line format.

0.60	20 February 2012
	* Corrected algorithm CRC-6/DARC per the CRC catalogue.
	* Standard input is read in binary mode under MinGW.
	* The user is advised to use reveng -D if a preset is not found.
	* The third-party getopt library has been removed.
	* Revised documentation.

0.50	7 September 2011
	* Argument files are read once.
	* Multiple argument files may be passed on standard input, with
	  EOF between them.

0.44	28 August 2011
	* Added algorithm CRC-64/XZ from the CRC catalogue.

0.43	27 August 2011
	* Fixed Init/Xorout reflection logic in -V and -v.
	* Searches wider than one machine word now proceed.
	* Aborts if compiled with the wrong values of BMPBIT and BMPSUB,
	  which can cause searches to malfunction.

0.42	3 May 2011
	* Removed redundant #include from bmpbit.c.

0.41	30 April 2011
	* Added algorithms CRC-16/TMS37157 and CRC-A and the new alias
	  CRC-B from the CRC catalogue.

0.40	10 February 2011
	* Made the preset model definitions ANSI C compliant.
	* The default is now to right-justify the output whenever
	  RefOut = False, and to left-justify it whenever RefOut = True.
	  This reconciles the output with the output of other
	  calculators.

0.31	4 February 2011
	* Corrected a transcription error in the Check value of
	  CRC-32/BZIP2.
	* Added 3 new aliases from the CRC catalogue.
	* Removed redundancies from the usage text.

0.30	18 January 2011
	* Fixed all ANSI C warnings.
	* Does not crash when -w is set to a small negative value.

0.21	15 January 2011
	* Added -k and -P options.
	* Invalid characters in hexadecimal arguments cause an error.
	* More efficient parsing of hexadecimal arguments.
	* Renamed some compile options.  Added NOFORCE.

0.20	11 January 2011
	* Renamed some switches.  Added -V switch to reverse an
	  algorithm (-v reverses the arguments and resulting CRC as
	  well, and its reversed model cannot be dumped with -d.)
	* With -f specified, a STRING equal to - (dash) causes an
	  argument to be read from standard input.
	* Option -m now matches model names case-insensitively.

0.13	8 January 2011
	* Fixed calculation of Init from a known XorOut.
	* Should successfully find models when RefIn and RefOut
	  differ.

0.12	7 January 2011
	* Added options -m and -X.
	* Forced -W and delisted the switch (still accepted) as narrow
	  search is broken.
	* Changed behaviour of preset scanning in -S to list all
	  matching models and filter against specified parameters.

0.11	5 January 2011
	* Fixed memory management during either-endian search.

0.10	5 January 2011
	* Initial release.
