System requirements of ARM Tube OS binary
Greg Cook, 7 February 2017

CRC RevEng has been tested on a 16MB SPROW ARM7TDMI Coprocessor running
ARM Tube OS version 0.45, with OS 1.20 and OPUS EDOS 0.4 (EDOSPAT 4.90)
on the host.  Installation on disc is strongly recommended.

To load and run the ARM Tube OS binary successfully, the Disc Filing
System (DFS) on the host computer must support at least the following:
- Full 32-bit address handling within *RUN (image loading and execution).
- Ability to load images >64 KiB to the coprocessor.
- Tolerance of OSARGS calls with A=2, Y=0.
- OSFIND must support reason codes with bits 3 and 2 set (see RISC OS 3
  Programmer's Reference Manual, volume 2, page 79)

This list is provisional and will be updated on further testing.
